# pythoncodes
A compilation of various python codes that I have implemented successfully. The files that end with a .py indicate the python files that I have coded. 
These are codes that were developed over a course of time frame from september to december. Includes basic games, graphical user interfaces, etc.. to get us geared up to code the extraction, transformation and loading of huge data sets into the python environment. 
I have used the PyCharm environment for all my coding purposes.
The ETL and the madlibs use excel sheets comprising of data sets which I have attached within the project itself.
